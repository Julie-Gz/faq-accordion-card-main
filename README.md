## OverView

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

One of the things I struggled with was allocating images to certain positions on the page and having them keep their proportions throughout different screen sizes. I used to stick to using the position property,  but I found that combining Flexbox with the position property produce better results.
